## Completeness

Percentage of elements properly populated (e.g. testing for NULLs and empty strings
where not appropriate)

## Value Validity

Percentage of elements whose attributes possess meaningful values (e.g. A comparison constraint like {male, female} or an interval constraint like age = [0,110])

## Longitudinal Consistency

A measure of the degree to which a attribute value that should remain static remains static over time.

## Record Consistency

A measure of the degree to which two or more data attributes satisfy a well-defined dependency constraint -- relationship validation (e.g. zip-code -- state consistencyÂ  or gender -- pregnancy consistency)

### Identify Outliers

## Uniqueness

The number of unique values taken by an attribute, or a combination of attributes in a dataset (e.g. frequency distribution of an element)

note. The more homogeneous the data values of an element, the less useful the element is for analysis

## Duplication

A measure of the degree of replication of distinct observations per observation unit type (e.g. greater than 1 registration per student per official reporting period)

note. Duplication occurs as a result of choice of level of aggregation
